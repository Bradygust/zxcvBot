# zxcvBot
This is the Team zxcv Discord Bot source code. Node.js & discord.js are *not* included. You must install these yourself.

In order to use this bot you must create a config.json file with the following objects:
- token  // Your bot's token
- pfx // Prefix for bot commands, usually !
- admin // Admin Role ID
- mod // Moderator Role ID

The Text RPG is currently the big feature I'm working on. In order to use this, you'll have to create your own SQL database. Information about this will be posted later.

This will be continually updated over time and may be bare bones right now.
