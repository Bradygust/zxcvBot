# zxcvBot
This is the Team zxcv Discord Bot source code. Node.js & discord.js are *not* included. You must install these yourself.

In order to use this bot you must create a config.json file with the following objects:
- token  // Your bot's token
- pfx // Prefix for bot commands, usually !
- admin // Admin Role ID
- mod // Moderator Role ID

This will be continually updated over time and may be bare bones right now.
